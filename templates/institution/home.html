  <h3>What's this about?</h3>
  <p>
    The digitized voting system is the final deliverable on my research project for the BCS course I am pursuing at Cavendish University.
    This follows research carried out at Makerere University to ascertain whether the current voting system is effective or efficient. 
    <br><br>Research showed there was a great need for a digitized voting system in touch with the modern technological landscape that exists today, 
    one that will save any institution money, hasten the election process, offer more accuracy and efficiency and especially, a robust 
    system that will serve the institution in times like today with COVID-19 where most academic institutions are still under lockdown.
